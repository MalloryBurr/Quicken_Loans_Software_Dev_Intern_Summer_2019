# Quicken Loans Software Dev Internship Summer 2019

In May of 2019, I returned to the Quicken Loans Family of Companies for the second time, this time as a software development intern with Quicken Loans. This will be my fourth internship (third full time summer internship) and I will update this guide throughout the summer to reflect my accomplishments and the knowledge I have gained.
